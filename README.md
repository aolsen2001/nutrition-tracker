# NutriLite (Work In Progress)

A webapp built using React with TypeScript that allows users to keep track of their daily meals.

This project is a work in progress, so some features might be missing/incomplete. I plan to continue working on this project for the forseeable future.

## Current Features

- Account creation and secure authentication through Firebase
- Viewing logged meals for the current date
- Logging new meals

## Planned Features

- Implementation of a Postgres database
- A C#/.NET backend API
- Viewing total calories, protein, fat, and carbs for a given date
