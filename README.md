# Nutrition Tracker (Work in Progress)

A webapp built using React with TypeScript that allows users to keep track of their daily meals.

This project is a work in progress, so some features might be missing/incomplete. I plan to continue working on this project for the forseeable future.

## Current Features

- Account creation and secure authentication through Firebase
- Persistence through a Postgres database
- Viewing logged meals for the current date
- Logging new meals
- Searching for foods and retrieving results from the FatSecret API from a C#/.NET backend
